\title{Get HPO term ontology level}
\usage{
get_ont_level(hpo, term_ids)
}
\arguments{
\item{hpo}{The Human phenotype ontology data object,
available in ontologyIndex package \<list\>}

\item{term_ids}{A HPO Id (e.g. "HP:0000001") or a
vector of multiple Ids \<string\> or \<vector_string\>}
}
\value{
Ontology level of HPO Id
}
\description{
In this function, ontology level refers to the number of generations of
sub-phenotypes a term has below it in the HPO DAG. For example, the root of
the HPO is term "HP:0000001", the longest path to a term with no child terms
is 14. In other words there are 14 generations of "is-a" relationships below
HP:0000001 and it is therefore at ontology level 14. A term with no
sub-phenotypes below it (a leaf node), is at ontology level 0.
}
\details{
Typically this function should be used to get the level of a single term,
but you can supply a vector of multiple terms and it will return the level of
the highest level term in that vector.
